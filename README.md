# surgical_tool_tracking_research
This is the research project (CSC494 in University of Toronto) supervised by Lueder Kahrs and Radian Gondokaryono, for surgical tool tracking.<br/>
Please view the project description at: https://usra.cs.toronto.edu/public/project/342?sort_by=0&opportunity_id=6 <br/>

My main jobs are:
  <ol>
  <li> Data simulation in Unity, include randomization, stereo camera implementation and camera calibration scene. </li>
  <li> Collect synthetic data with key points (by perception package), then use the data for triangulation (get 3D key points from 2D key points). </li>
  <li> Design camera calibration and triangulation pipeline. </li>
  <li> Create and label the training data, then use the data to train the 2D key point detection model (in deeplabcut). </li>
  </ol>
 Special thanks for Mustafa Haiderbhai in MedCVR, who contributes many scripts I adapted for my work.
